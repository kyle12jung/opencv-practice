# opencv-practice
This repository serves to practice the python opencv library. I will be building some small projects in this repo.
 1. Practice
 This folder contains files to play around and practice the widely used opencv commands and functions.
 
 2. Face Detector
 I created a face detector using the opencv haar_cascade. 
 
 3. Face Recognizer
 I created a face recognizer that could classify people based on the training set.
 This was not a big project so the training set contains around a 100 images, but does a decent job of classifying based on the training set.
